Def:- An algorithm is a set of instructions to perform a task or to solve a problem.
    Ex:-A recipe book contains all the instructions about various dishes.where each recipe is an algorithm.

Algorithm analysis:-
-----------------------
->The analysis of an algorithm mainly deals with finding a algorithm which execute in less time and takes
    less memory.

                Time Complexity:-
                ----------------

->The amount of time taken by algo to run.
->The input *processed* by an algorithm, helps in determining the time complexity.

                Space complexity:-
                -------------------
->The amount of memory or space taken by algo to run.
->The memory required to process the input, determines the spaces complexity.

Asymptotic Analysis of an algorithm:-
----------------------------------------
->Asymptotic analysis helps in evaluating the performance of a algorithm in terms of input size and its
increase.
->using this, we don't measure the actual running time of an algo.
->It helps in determining, how time and space taken by algo increases or changes, with input size.

Asymptotic Notations:-
---------------------
->They are just the mathematical tools, which is used to determine the running time of an algo in terms
of input size.
->It helps in determining the:-
    Best case
    Average case
    Worst case

Types of Asymptotic Notations:-
------------------------------
->There are 3 notations which evaluate the running time of an algo
    Omega Notation
    Big O Notation
    Theta Notation

                                Omega Notation
                                ----------------
->It expresses the lower bound of an algo's running time.
->lower bound means for any given input,this notation determines the best amount of time an algo take to
complete.

                                Big O Notation:
                                ---------------
->It expresses the upper bound of an algo's running time.
->upper bound means for any given input,this notation determines the longest amount of time an algo take
to complete.

                                Theta Notation:
                                ----------------
-> It expresses the upper and lower bound of an algo's running time.
->It means for any given input,this notation determines the average amount of time an algo take
     to complete.


Analysis of time complexity(Big O Notation):-
----------------------------------------------
Rules:-
->We should assume the machine as single processor and executes the statements sequentially.
->Every assignment operation takes 1 unit of time.
->Return statement takes 1 unit of time.
->Arithmetic operation takes 1 unit of time.
->Logical operation takes 1 unit of time.
->Other small/single operation takes 1 unit of time.
->Drop lower order terms
like, T=3n^2+3n+2==>O(n^2)
->Drop constant multipliers.
like, for above example, we are neglecting the 3 of n^2, because of constant multiplier.


Calculating the time complexity of a constant algo:-
