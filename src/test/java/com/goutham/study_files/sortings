Bubble sort:-
------------
->Also known as sinking sort, as it places the largest element at the end of the array.
->It checks the adjacent elements and sorts them.

Insertion sort:-
-------------------
->this sorting algo is same as sorting the playing cards in our hands.
->In insertion sort, we divide the given array into two parts- sorted and unsorted.
->From unsorted, we take the first element and place at it's correct position in sorted array.
->This is done by shifting all the elements larger than the first element by one position.

Selection sort:-
----------------
->In this sort, we divide the given array into two parts- sorted and unsorted.
->This algo sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum in an unsorted array and making it part of a
sorted array.

Merge Sort:-
-----------
->It's a divide and conquer algo.
->Divide the problem into sub problems, until the sub problems can be solved directly.
->After that, combine the solutions of sub problems to get the original problem solution.
