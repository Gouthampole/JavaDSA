Linked list:-
-----------------

->Linked list comes under linear data structure, where the data or element is stored in nodes.
->every node contains two parts,
    one to store data.
    other to store the address of next node.

Types:-
1.Singly Linked list
2.Doubly Linked list
3.Circular Linked list

1.Singly Linked list
---------------------
->It is a ds, used for storing collection of nodes.
->It contains seq of nodes.
->A node has data and ref to next node
->First node is known as head
->Last node has data and the ref of node points to null.

Implementation:

public class ListNode<T>{
private T data;
private ListNode<T> next;
}


//for merge two sorted ll
SinglyLinkedList res=new SinglyLinkedList();
        res.head=merge(a.head,b.head);
        res.print();

Doubly Linked list:-
------------------
->It is a two way linked list.
->we can traverse both in forward and backward direction, because of prev and next pointers.

CircularLinked list:-
---------------------
->same as singly linked list, but the last node is pointing it's next pointer to the first node.
